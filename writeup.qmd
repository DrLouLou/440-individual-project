### Abstract

**Introduction and Data**: Durham is one of the largest and fastest-growing cities in North Carolina. As such, it is essential for City Council and administrators to identify the most strategic areas for investment, growth, and service improvement. To provide a solid empirical basis for those decisions, the City commissioned the 2022 City of Durham Resident Survey conducted between December 2022 and January 2023. A four-page questionnaire, cover letter, and postage-paid return envelope were mailed to a random sample of Durham households, with an identical online option promoted by follow-up emails about ten days later. Every online submission was matched to its sampled street address to ensure that only real residents were counted.

Our analysis focuses on how residents’ perceived quality-of-life (QoL) satisfaction varies with their length of time living in Durham. We also test two secondary questions: (1) whether being a renter versus an owner influences that satisfaction, and (2) whether satisfaction scores within the same neighborhood are spatially independent. To answer these questions, we used the variable in Q3 of the survey entitled “Quality of life in Durham” as our outcome, which was graded on a 5 point scale where 5 means very satisfied and 1 means very dissatisfied.

**Methodology**: We first assessed whether OLS was appropriate by testing the independence assumption: geographic data can violate this if nearby residents share unmeasured influences, suggesting spatial‐lag or spatial‐error models might be needed. We cleaned and geocoded the survey data—filtering out records missing latitude/longitude, converting block centroids to true decimal degrees, and using complete cases on QoL (Q3) and all covariates (years lived in Durham, tenure status, age, gender, Hispanic origin, income, inside-city indicator) yielding N = 852. Because area-based indicators like ZIP or PAC zones are too coarse and fixed-distance bands break under density heterogeneity, we constructed a symmetric six-nearest-neighbor (6-NN) graph—jittering duplicate coordinates to avoid one-way links. We then fitted a conventional OLS model predicting QoL and applied stepwise AIC to refine it; the final model retained only years lived in Durham, tenure status, their interaction, and gender dummy variables. To ensure our residuals were spatially uncorrelated—and thus OLS inference valid—we computed global Moran’s I on the residuals using row-standardized 6-NN weights. Finally, we generated a Local Moran’s I (LISA) map to flag any localized clusters of residuals significant at α = 0.05, confirming that our spatial diagnostics support a non-spatial OLS specification.

**Results**: After confirming that our OLS residuals exhibit no spatial autocorrelation (global Moran’s I ≈ –0.008, Exp = –0.001, Var \< 0.001; z = –0.406, p = 0.658; LISA map in Figure 1 shows no meaningful clustering), we proceeded with a stepwise‐AIC‐selected linear model. That model (shown in Table 1)—retaining years lived in Durham, tenure (Own vs. Rent) plus their interaction, and gender categories—explains only 1.6% of the variance in QoL satisfaction (R² = 0.016, Adj R² = 0.008; F-statistic = 1.950, p = 0.059). Aside from a large “Other” gender coefficient (β = –2.783, p = 0.030) and a tenure and years interaction for renters (β = –0.010 per year, p = 0.035)—which translates into a practically negligible 0.01-point drop in QoL per extra year—the remaining predictors are all statistically non‐significant at the 0.05 level. Neither residential tenure, length of residence, nor basic demographics are meaningfully associated with reported QoL, suggesting that unmeasured influences or the coarse five‐point QoL measure itself may obscure the true determinants of life satisfaction.

**Discussion**: Our primary goal was to assess whether overall QoL satisfaction is associated with how long residents have lived in Durham, and secondarily to determine if that relationship differs between homeowners and renters—while also testing for spatial dependence. Spatial diagnostics confirmed that residuals from our model behave independently, so we could validly apply ordinary least squares. Yet even after stepwise AIC pruning, the model—which included years lived, tenure status, their interaction, age, gender, Hispanic origin, income bracket, and inside-city indicator—explains a mere 1.6% of the variance in QoL. Aside from a very small interaction effect, none of the predictors approach statistical or practical significance. This suggests that either our variables are missing the true drivers of life-satisfaction or that a single five-point QoL item is too coarse to detect subtle effects. Future work could therefore explore alternative spatial weight matrices (e.g. systematically tuning k or using ZIP- and PAC-based areal adjacency), expand the predictor set to include multi-item service and neighborhood quality scales or objective amenity measures, and refine the outcome by deploying a more nuanced QoL instrument or leveraging mixed-methods (e.g. focus groups or resident interviews) to discover other factors shaping perceived quality of life.

### Extended Methodology

In order to determine what type of model we should fit to the data, we must first test whether the assumption of independence holds for OLS regression. Geographic data often violate this assumption as people who live close to one another frequently share unmeasured influences e.g. proximity to parks, traffic, or schools - that can induce spatial autocorrelation. If this assumption is violated, our standard linear model would be unreliable and we should fit spatial-lag model or spatial-error model instead. 

To prepare a spatial object that is ready for mapping or distance-based analysis, we first filter out any survey records missing longitude or latitude, convert the remaining coordinates to true decimal degrees, and then transform the cleaned data frame into an sf spatial object. Then, we simplify column names that are important to our analysis and ensure these columns are the correct data type and contain the correct levels if they are factors. We then load in a shapefile\[1\] of Durham County to map our points onto. Next, we defined our analysis sample by retaining only those records with non-missing values in the dependent variable (QoL) and all covariates (years lived in Durham, ownership status, age, gender, Hispanic origin, income, inside-city indicator). This complete-case approach yielded N = 852 observations for modeling.

In the survey data, there are several indicators of locality, in addition to latitude and longitude, that one could use for analyzing spatial dependence: PAC (Partners Against Crime) and ZIP. However, it makes the most sense to use latitude and longitude, as the other two options, which are area-based, result in a much more coarse analysis. Two households in the same ZIP can be kilometers apart, while adjacent ZIP edges can split next-door neighbors, an instance of the modifiable-areal-unit problem\[2\]. A fixed distance band is also problematic here: downtown Durham is dense, whereas the rural north is sparse. Any radius large enough to give rural points a reasonable number of neighbours would crowd urban points with dozens, inflating their row sums, while a smaller radius would leave many rural observations isolated and break the weight matrix.

In order to address these problems and reduce the arbitrariness of the analysis, a k-nearest-neighbor graph was used, using k=6 neighbors for each respondent. Comparative studies of spatial-dependence tests\[3\] report that KNN matrices with k=6 yield balanced power and Type I error rates in simulations across several hundred to a thousand observations, which suits our case of around 900 rows. To avoid one-way links caused by duplicate coordinates from the same building-centroid, we applied a negligible (\< 1 cm) jitter before building the graph. This ensures that we can preserve all data while keeping the neighbour list symmetric.

We then fitted a conventional OLS model, regressing overall QoL satisfaction on years lived in Durham, owner vs renter status and their interaction, plus controls for age, gender, Hispanic origin, income bracket, and whether the respondent lives inside the city limits. We then used stepwise AIC to refine the model. The selected model retained only years lived in Durham, tenure status (Owner vs Renter), their interaction term, and the set of gender dummy variables—all other covariates were dropped as they did not improve model fit.

In order to confirm that our OLS errors satisfy the independence assumption, we computed global Moran’s I on the model residuals using our row-standardized six-nearest-neighbour weight matrix. Moran’s I tests whether positive or negative residuals cluster more than expected under spatial randomness; a non-significant result indicates that any spatial structure has been adequately absorbed by the model. In our case, Moran’s I fell near zero and was not statistically significant, so we can confidently proceed without a spatial-lag or spatial-error model and rely on the standard OLS inference.

Finally, we produced a Local Moran’s I (LISA) map to pinpoint any localized spatial autocorrelation in our OLS residuals. The LISA statistic assesses, for each respondent, whether their model error is more similar to those of their six nearest neighbors than would be expected under spatial randomness—identifying “hot spots” (high‐high clusters) and “cold spots” (low‐low clusters) as well as spatial outliers. In the map, only observations with a local Moran’s I significant at α = 0.05 are colored (green for positive clusters, purple for negative outliers), while all non‐significant locations are shown in light grey. \
