### Abstract

**Introduction and Data**: Durham is one of the largest and fastest-growing cities in North Carolina. As such, it is essential for City Council and administrators to identify the most strategic areas for investment, growth, and service improvement. To provide a solid empirical basis for those decisions, the City commissioned the 2022 City of Durham Resident Survey conducted between December 2022 and January 2023. A four-page questionnaire, cover letter, and postage-paid return envelope were mailed to a random sample of Durham households, with an identical online option promoted by follow-up emails about ten days later. Every online submission was matched to its sampled street address to ensure that only real residents were counted.

Our analysis focuses on how residents’ perceived quality-of-life (QoL) satisfaction varies with their length of time living in Durham. We also test two secondary questions: (1) whether being a renter versus an owner influences that satisfaction, and (2) whether satisfaction scores within the same neighborhood are spatially independent. To answer these questions, we used the variable in Q3 of the survey entitled “Quality of life in Durham” as our outcome, which was graded on a 5 point scale where 5 means very satisfied and 1 means very dissatisfied.

**Methodology**: We began by assembling a clean, complete‐case spatial sample (N = 852) of survey responses with non‐missing QoL ratings and covariates (years in Durham, tenure, age, gender, Hispanic origin, income, inside-city). After geocoding each household to decimal-degree latitude/longitude (and adding a tiny jitter to break duplicate centroids), we built a six-nearest-neighbour (6-NN) graph. With that in place, we fit a standard OLS model predicting QoL satisfaction from years lived, tenure status, their interaction, and the demographic controls. To confirm the residuals were spatially uncorrelated (and thus that OLS inference remains valid), we computed global Moran’s I on the residuals using our 6-NN weights—finding it near zero and non-significant. Finally, we produced three key diagnostics: (1) an interaction plot of satisfaction versus tenure × years to visualize differing slopes for owners and renters, (2) a residual spatial map coloring each point by its model error, and (3) a Local Moran’s I (LISA) map highlighting any significant local clusters (none were found).

**Results**: After confirming that our OLS residuals exhibit no spatial autocorrelation (global Moran’s I ≈ –0.008, Exp = –0.0012, Var = 0.00031; z = –0.21, p = 0.58; residual and LISA maps show no significant clustering), we proceeded with a stepwise‐AIC‐selected linear model. That model—retaining years lived in Durham, tenure (Own vs. Rent) plus their interaction, and gender categories—explains only 1.6% of the variance in QoL satisfaction (R² = 0.016, Adj R² = 0.008; F(7,844) = 1.95, p ≈ 0.059). Aside from a large “Other” gender coefficient (β = –2.783, p = 0.030) and a tenure×years interaction for renters (β = –0.010 per year, p = 0.035)—which translates into a practically negligible 0.01-point drop in QoL per extra year—the remaining predictors are all non‐significant (p \> 0.05). In short, neither residential tenure, length of residence, nor basic demographics meaningfully drive reported QoL, suggesting that unmeasured influences or the coarse five‐point QoL measure itself may obscure the true determinants of life satisfaction.

**Discussion**: Our primary goal was to assess whether overall quality-of-life (QoL) satisfaction is associated with how long residents have lived in Durham, and secondarily to determine if that relationship differs between homeowners and renters—while also testing for spatial dependence that might violate OLS assumptions. Spatial diagnostics (global Moran’s I ≈ –0.005, p = 0.58; LISA maps showing no significant local clusters) confirmed that residuals from our model behave independently, so we could validly apply ordinary least squares. Yet even after stepwise AIC pruning, the model—which included years lived, tenure status, their interaction, age, gender, Hispanic origin, income bracket, and inside-city indicator—explains a mere 1.6 % of the variance in QoL (R² = 0.016). Aside from a vanishingly small interaction effect (each additional year in Durham predicts a 0.01-point QoL drop among renters), none of the predictors approach statistical or practical significance. This suggests that either our variables are missing the true drivers of life-satisfaction—such as neighborhood safety, access to green spaces, commute burden, or social cohesion—or that a single five-point QoL item is too coarse to detect subtle effects. Future work should therefore explore alternative spatial weight matrices (e.g. systematically tuning k or using ZIP- and PAC-based areal adjacency), expand the predictor set to include multi-item service and neighborhood quality scales or objective amenity measures, and refine the outcome by deploying a more nuanced QoL instrument or leveraging mixed-methods (e.g. focus groups or resident interviews) to surface latent factors shaping perceived quality of life.

### Extended Methodology

In order to determine what type of model we should fit to the data, we must first test whether the assumption of independence holds for OLS regression. Geographic data often violate this assumption as people who live close to one another frequently share unmeasured influences e.g. proximity to parks, traffic, or schools - that can induce spatial autocorrelation. If this assumption is violated, our standard linear model would be unreliable and we should fit spatial-lag model or spatial-error model instead. 

To prepare a spatial object that is ready for mapping or distance-based analysis, we first filter out any survey records missing longitude or latitude, convert the remaining coordinates to true decimal degrees, and then transform the cleaned data frame into an sf spatial object. Then, we simplify column names that are important to our analysis and ensure these columns are the correct data type and contain the correct levels if they are factors. We then load in a shapefile\[1\] of Durham County to map our points onto. Next, we defined our analysis sample by retaining only those records with non-missing values in the dependent variable (QoL) and all covariates (years lived in Durham, ownership status, age, gender, Hispanic origin, income, inside-city indicator). This complete-case approach yielded N = 852 observations for modeling.

In the survey data, there are several indicators of locality, in addition to latitude and longitude, that one could use for analyzing spatial dependence: PAC (Partners Against Crime) and ZIP. However, it makes the most sense to use latitude and longitude, as the other two options, which are area-based, result in a much more coarse analysis. Two households in the same ZIP can be kilometers apart, while adjacent ZIP edges can split next-door neighbors, an instance of the modifiable-areal-unit problem\[2\]. A fixed distance band is also problematic here: downtown Durham is dense, whereas the rural north is sparse. Any radius large enough to give rural points a reasonable number of neighbours would crowd urban points with dozens, inflating their row sums, while a smaller radius would leave many rural observations isolated and break the weight matrix.

In order to address these problems and reduce the arbitrariness of the analysis, a k-nearest-neighbor graph was used, using k=6 neighbors for each respondent. Comparative studies of spatial-dependence tests\[3\] report that KNN matrices with k = 6 yield balanced power and Type I error rates in simulations across several hundred to a thousand observations, which suits our case of around 900 rows. To avoid one-way links caused by duplicate coordinates from the same building-centroid, we applied a negligible (\< 1 cm) jitter before building the graph. This ensures that we can preserve all data while keeping the neighbour list symmetric.

We then fitted a conventional OLS model, regressing overall QoL satisfaction on years lived in Durham, owner vs renter status and their interaction, plus controls for age, gender, Hispanic origin, income bracket, and whether the respondent lives inside the city limits.

In order to confirm that our OLS errors satisfy the independence assumption, we computed global Moran’s I on the model residuals using our row-standardized six-nearest-neighbour weight matrix. Moran’s I tests whether positive or negative residuals cluster more than expected under spatial randomness; a non-significant result indicates that any spatial structure has been adequately absorbed by the model. In our case, Moran’s I fell near zero and was not statistically significant, so we can confidently proceed without a spatial-lag or spatial-error model and rely on the standard OLS inference.

Finally, we created an interaction plot that displays how overall QoL satisfaction varies with years lived in Durham for owners versus renters: by fitting separate linear smoothers for each tenure group, it lets us visually assess whether the slope of satisfaction over time differs between homeowners and renters. The residual spatial map then takes the residuals from our OLS model and colors each point by its magnitude (red for negative, blue for positive), so we can immediately see whether there are geographic “hot” or “cold” spots in what the model fails to explain. Finally, the Local Moran’s I (LISA) map highlights only those locations where the local autocorrelation statistic is significant (p \< 0.05), identifying any small clusters of unusually high or low satisfaction—if such clusters existed, they would show up in color against a neutral background.\
